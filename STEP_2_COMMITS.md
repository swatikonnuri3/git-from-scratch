Topic: Committing Changes

1. Modify file → Git detects change
2. git diff → shows what changed (changes btn current commit and previous commit)
3. git add → stage changes
4. git commit → save changes
5. git log → view history with summary
6. git log --oneline - show the commit in oneline , reduce the commits summarize it 

Each commit is a snapshot of the project.
